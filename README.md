Firstly, a suitable reference voltage source chip is selected, then the excitation source circuit with better stability is designed, a high-order filter is designed for filtering, and finally a compensation circuit is designed to improve the accuracy of the lasers voltage source.

The designed voltage source circuit was improved in output voltage accuracy, stability, and noise level, achieving a voltage noise level of **0.978 μV/Hz1/2 at 0.1 mHz at an input voltage of 2V**. The validity of the voltage source circuit used for the lasers is verified, providing a high reference value for improving the lasers accuracy in laser spectroscopy.
